Subject: Data Quality Issues and Analysis Results

Hello Stakeholders,

I wanted to share findings from our recent data analysis and the process used to identify and address data quality issues.

Data Quality Issues:
1] Missing Values: No critical missing values detected.
2] Duplicate Records: No duplicates found.
3] Inconsistent Data: No negative spends or future dates.

Below I have tried my best to answer some of your questions:

1] What questions do you have about the data?
     - Are there any specific business rules or constraints that we should be aware of while handling the data?
     - Are there any known limitations or issues with the data collection process?

2] How did you discover the data quality issues?
     - We used SQL queries to check for missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data patterns (example: negative spends, future dates).

3] What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
     - Understanding acceptable ranges and values for key metrics.
     - Business rules for handling records with missing critical fields (example: `user_id`, `purchase_date`).

4] What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
     - Additional context on the data collection process and any known limitations.
     - Historical data to identify long-term trends and patterns.

5] What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
   i) Concerns:
        - Handling large volumes of data efficiently.
        - Ensuring data integrity and consistency during real-time processing.
   ii) Plans:
        - Implement indexing on critical fields to improve query performance.
        - Conduct regular data audits and use automated validation scripts to maintain data quality.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.

Best regards,
